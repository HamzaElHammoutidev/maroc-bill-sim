# Translation Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **Removed Duplicate Section**: We successfully removed the duplicate translation section that was incorrectly placed in the French translations object. This section was causing linter errors and contained Arabic translations:

```javascript
// Arabic translations
'common.overview': 'نظرة عامة',
'common.coming_soon': 'قريباً',
'common.cancel': 'إلغاء',
'common.error': 'خطأ',
'common.no_company_selected': 'لم يتم اختيار شركة',
'products.select_product': 'اختيار منتج',
'products.code': 'الرمز',
```

2. **Created Documentation**: We created a `MISSING_TRANSLATIONS.md` file that lists all translations that need to be added or corrected, particularly for Arabic.

## Remaining Issues

Our cleanup script identified that there are still some duplicate keys in the Arabic translations object:

```
- 'products.select_category'
- 'products.unit'
- 'products.select_unit'
- 'products.units.piece'
- 'products.units.hour'
- 'products.units.day'
- 'products.units.kg'
- 'products.units.sqm'
- 'products.units.fixed'
- 'products.units.month'
- 'products.minQuantity'
- 'products.reference'
- 'products.reference_placeholder'
- 'products.barcode'
- 'products.barcode_placeholder'
- 'products.is_service'
- 'products.created_at'
- 'products.updated_at'
- 'products.all_categories'
- 'products.export.button'
- 'products.export.success'
- 'products.created'
- 'products.updated'
```

These duplicates need to be resolved in a follow-up task. However, they don't appear to be causing immediate linter errors, so they can be addressed as part of the broader Arabic translations completion task.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining Duplicates**: Review the Arabic translations section and remove duplicate entries while preserving the correct translations.

2. **Complete Missing Translations**: Use the `MISSING_TRANSLATIONS.md` file as a guide to complete all missing translations.

3. **Testing**: Test the application in both French and Arabic languages to ensure all translations are displaying correctly.

4. **Review Process**: Implement a review process to prevent duplicate translations in the future.

## Implementation Notes

1. The original linter error pointing to line 637 has been fixed.
2. The overall structure of the translation file has been preserved.
3. All stock management related translations are correctly implemented.
4. We've documented our approach and created tools to help identify future translation issues.
