# Implementation Notes - Stock Management Module

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- **Data Model Extensions**: Extended Product interface with stock-related fields (manageStock, currentStock, minStock, alertStock, locationId).
- **New Stock Data Models**: Created StockLocation, StockMovement, Inventory, and InventoryItem interfaces.
- **Mock Data**: Added mock data for stock locations and stock movements.
- **Translations**: Added necessary translations for stock management in both French and Arabic languages.
- **Fixed Duplicate Translations**: Removed duplicate translation entries that were causing linter errors.

### In Progress
- **UI Components**: Development of stock management views (locations, movements, inventory checks).
- **Business Logic**: Implementation of stock movement tracking and automatic updates.
- **Stock Settings**: Configuration options for stock behavior.

## Known Issues

1. **Translation Object Structure**: There were duplicate translations in the LanguageContext.tsx file that have now been fixed.
2. **Type Mismatches**: The SidebarLink component in MainLayout.tsx has type mismatches that need resolution.
3. **DataTable Implementation**: Need to implement proper DataTable for stock movements and inventory displays.
4. **Stock Validation**: Need to implement validation rules for stock quantities and alerts.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete UI Implementation**:
   - Create Stock Locations management view
   - Build Stock Movements listing with filtering
   - Implement Inventory Check workflow

2. **Integration with Invoicing**:
   - Connect invoice creation with stock updates
   - Add validation to prevent invoicing when stock is insufficient (if enabled)

3. **Reporting Features**:
   - Implement stock reports (low stock, movement history, valuation)
   - Add stock charts to dashboard

4. **Documentation**:
   - Complete user documentation for stock management features
   - Add inline comments and JSDoc for new components

## Testing Instructions

1. **Accessing Stock Management**:
   - Navigate to Stock Management from main navigation
   - Verify access to stock overview, movements, and locations

2. **Product Stock Configuration**:
   - Edit a product and enable stock management
   - Set minimum and alert thresholds
   - Assign a stock location

3. **Stock Movements**:
   - Create a new stock entry (purchase)
   - Create a stock exit (sale)
   - Verify stock levels update correctly

4. **Inventory Checks**:
   - Initiate an inventory check
   - Update counts and verify adjustments
   - Confirm history records are created

## Documentation on Translation Fixes

We identified and fixed duplicated translation entries in the LanguageContext.tsx file that were causing linter errors. The issue was a duplicate section of Arabic translations that appeared in the French section of the translations object. The problematic section looked like:

```javascript
// Arabic translations
'common.overview': 'نظرة عامة',
'common.coming_soon': 'قريباً',
'common.cancel': 'إلغاء',
'common.error': 'خطأ',
'common.no_company_selected': 'لم يتم اختيار شركة',
'products.select_product': 'اختيار منتج',
'products.code': 'الرمز',
```

This section was removed from the file to fix the linter errors, as these translations already existed in the main Arabic translations object.

We also created a `MISSING_TRANSLATIONS.md` file that lists all the translations that still need to be added or corrected, particularly for the Arabic language.
